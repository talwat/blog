## The premise

I want to challenge myself to see just how much I can accomplish with only a TTY at my disposal.

## The results

This is a table of the general things I was able to do, summed up.

I'll probably update this from time to time.

| Task     | Was I able to do it?          | What was the experience like                                                                                                                                                           |

| Emailing | 游리 Yes, but it's not easy.    | The drawbacks were that I couldn't actually send emails, only look at them.                                                                                                            |
| Browsing | 游릭 Yes!                       | There were many options, and a lot of basic websites worked on most. <br> On [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/), you could probably get all websites (except video ones) to work.          |
| Discord  | 游릭 Yes!                       | Using [discordo](https://github.com/ayntgl/discordo), it worked like a charm.                                                                                                          |
| Reddit   | 游리 Yes, but with limitations. | Using [tuir](https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir), I could browse reddit very easily, but I could not login as this requires a graphical browser.                                             |
| Gaming   | 游리 Difficult, but possible.   | Playing games was a huge challenge, but eventually I managed to get a gameboy emulator working. <br> There are also a lot of other good terminal games, but it's not ideal for gaming. |
