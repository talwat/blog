## The premise

I want to challenge myself to see just how much I can accomplish with only a TTY at my disposal.

## TL;DR

This is a table of the general things I was able to do, summed up.

| Task     | Was I able to do it?          | What was the experience like                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emailing | 🟠 No, but it's possible.     | I wasn't able to because google recently disabled the option to use SMTP which sucks. <br> But if I were to get it working it would be pretty great.                                   |
| Browsing | 🟢 Yes!                       | There were many options, and a lot of basic websites worked on most. <br> On [browsh](https://www.brow.sh/), you could probably get all websites (except video ones) to work.          |
| Discord  | 🟢 Yes!                       | Using [discordo](https://github.com/ayntgl/discordo), it worked like a charm.                                                                                                          |
| Reddit   | 🟡 Yes, but with limitations. | Using [tuir](https://gitlab.com/ajak/tuir), I could browse reddit very easily, but I could not login as this requires a graphical browser.                                             |
| Gaming   | 🟡 Difficult, but possible.   | Playing games was a huge challenge, but eventually I managed to get a gameboy emulator working. <br> There are also a lot of other good terminal games, but it's not ideal for gaming. |
