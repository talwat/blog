## Introduction

I've mostly forgotten about this blog, but I've been getting the itch to continue posting on here.

The code is quite spaghetti, but for now, I plan to just write things that interest me.

I'm sure nobody will read this, but if they do, hi!

## So what next?

I might move away from github pages, since I'm stuck with a sub-page (`/blog`),
and 404 pages are inconsistent without it.

Vercel is an option, or maybe i'll think of something else. Either way, I will try and
post more often.

In fact, I'm writing this on my birthday, which is something.

The type of content I want to put here will moreso be guides rather than comparisons
and my opinions, because I find it fun to explain things to other people and have an outlet
like this.

## Why are the posts so short?

I can't write a lot, I condense information, and in my opinion, posts don't need to be long.
