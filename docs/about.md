## About me

Hi! I'm Tal.

I love programming and computers. I'm trying to get into more low level computing recently.
I also like Linux and open source software. Some of my other hobbies are coffee (both drinking and brewing),
and more recently, model airplanes. I also like mathematics and I mainly use vscode.

## This blog

Thought I should mention this, but this blog uses the (excellent) [everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) color pallete.
So props to them!

I pretty much made this blog to learn svelte & sveltekit, but that means that the code is pretty garbage.
Thankfully, I wrote it in a such a way that I didn't need to edit the code to make new blog posts.

I usually will post on here if I either want to share a guide of sorts or something like that.
